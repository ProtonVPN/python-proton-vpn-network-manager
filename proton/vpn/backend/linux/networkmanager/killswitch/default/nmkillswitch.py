    Kill Switch implementation using NetworkManager.

    A dummy Network Manager connection is created to block all non-VPN traffic.

    added with a lower priority than the VPN connection but with a higher
    priority than the other network manager connections. This way, the routing
    table uses the dummy connection for any traffic that does not go to the
    primary VPN connection.
