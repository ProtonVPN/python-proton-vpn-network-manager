    Kill Switch implementation using NetworkManager.

    The way it works is that the dummy connection blocking non-VPN traffic is
    added with a lower priority than the VPN connection but with a higher
    priority than the other network manager connections. This way, the routing
    table uses the dummy connection for any traffic that does not go to the
    primary VPN connection.
